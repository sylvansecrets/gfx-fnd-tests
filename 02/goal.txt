Given a JSON description of a room and a camera, report on what the camera sees.

Your program should take two arguments: the first is an input .json file, the second is output.

The input file will contain one JSON object, roughly like this:

    {
      walls: [
        { x0: -1, y0: 1, x1: 3, y1: 5 },
        { x0: 3, y0: -2, x1: 3, y1: 2 },
      ],
      camera_x: 0.5
      camera_y: 1.0,
      angles: [
        0,
        1.5708,
        4,
      ],
    }

Note that angles are measured in radians, and the angle system is one used by math nerds, not the
more common clock-face system..  If you stand at 0,0, and your angle is 0 radians, you are looking
along the positive x-axis, towards (1000, 0).  If you change your angle to pi/2 radians (a.k.a.  90
degrees), you are looking along the positive y-axis, towards (0, 1000).

You should write an output file, containing one JSON object, roughly like this:

    {
      collisions: [
        { wall: 1, distance: 2.5 },
        { wall: 0, distance: 1.499 },
        { wall: undefined, distance: Infinity },
      ]
    }

That's three answers (in one file), corresponding to the three 'angles' in the input JSON.

collisions[i] is the answer to this question: if these walls exist, and we start a ray at the
coordinates (camera_x, camera_y), and we shoot that ray in the direction indicated by angle[i], what
wall will we hit, and how far away will it be?

Wall IDs should be precise, of course.  At this time I haven't yet written the tester for this
problem, but I intend that it should allow a tiny bit of flexibility in the distance, perhaps 0.1%.
